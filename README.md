# MGraphicsLib - An OpenGL Graphics Library for Android

The graphics library I use for my OpenGL projects. It is very much a work in progress, and will change drastically very often. There are currently some major issues that need to be resolved with textures on some phones, so I don't advise using this at the moment.
